1) We can ensure Port 22 on the web server instance is only accessible by Trusted IP sources.
2)Also by Default, SSH listens on port 22 which is widely known among attackers and security tools/port scanners like hydra that launch brute force attack in our environment, you can specify a custom SSH port instead known to only Trusted entities in the organisation.
3) Set up a Web Application Firewall(WAF) in front of our public facing services to inspect HTTP traffic for unusual traffic that could signify exploitation attempts and block them.
