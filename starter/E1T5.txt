Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The Web Application security group allows access to all the Web Application Ports from all IP address making it easy for attackers to gain access to the Web application.

# Poor practice 2
The IAM Role specified in the IamInstanceProfile of both the Attack Instance and Web Application gives access to all S3 Buckets thereby breaking the least privilege rule.
